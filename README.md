# [AAAI 2026] UniMo: Unified Motion Generation and Understanding with Chain of Thought

UniMo is a novel unified framework for **3D human motion generation and understanding** that leverages the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) enhanced by Chain of Thought (CoT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning. UniMo bridges the gap between natural language and human motion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both text-to-motion (T2M) and motion-to-text (M2T) tasks.
